    <p>
        This blog's still very much WIP - there's not much content, and posts
        don't yet have a table of contents. I'm currently working on a Lua
        runtime to embed in my website's compiler; once that's done, this will
        start looking a lot nicer.
        <br /><br />
        So, TLDR, you may want to check back in a couple of weeks.
