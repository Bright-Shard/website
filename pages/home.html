    I'm <b>BrightShard</b>, an 18-year-old developer, hacker, and rhythm
    gamer.<br /><br />

    I write high-quality, dependency-free, AI-free Rust libraries that help
    developers write code faster. You can see an overview of my projects
    <a href="#page-projects">here</a> or
    <a

        target="_blank"

        >on GitHub</a
    >. You can also read about some of the more creative code I've written and
    various other thoughts <a href="#page-blog">on my blog</a>.<br /><br />

    By the way, all of the content of this website is a single file - so after
    it's loaded once, you can keep viewing it offline! It's also embeddable as
    an
    <a href="index.svg">SVG</a>, like so:

    <br /><br /><br />
    <object
        type="image/svg+xml"
        width="800"
        height="500"
        data="index.svg"
    ></object>
