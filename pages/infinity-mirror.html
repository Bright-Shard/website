<h1 class="title">Infinity Mirror</h1>
<p>
	My website is embeddable <a href="/index.svg">as an SVG</a>, so you can do
	this:
</p>
<object
	type="image/svg+xml"
	data="index.svg#infinity-mirror"
	width="800px"
	height="500px"
></object>
<p>
	Depending on your browser, the image might stop repeating at a certain depth.
	It'll also switch to the mobile view once it gets small enough.
	<br /><br />
	If you want to embed my site, use one of the following HTML snippets:
</p>
<code>
	&lt;object type="image/svg+xml" width="800px" height="500px"
	data="https://brightshard.dev/index.svg"&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</code
>
<br />
<code>
	&lt;img width="800px" height="500px" src="https://brightshard.dev/index.svg"
	/&gt;
</code>
<p>
	You can set it to the infinity mirror page by adding
	<code>#infinity-mirror</code> to the end of the URL. You can also change the
	width and height properties to whatever you want. <br /><br />
	The first snippet is interactable (you can click and navigate around the
	site). The second unfortunately is not.
