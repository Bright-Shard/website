# -r: monitor directories recursively
# -e close_write: watch for files being closed after being opened in write mode
# -e delete: watch for deleted files
# --exclude $ROOT/builder/target: don't watch the builder/target folder - this
#   is the Rust build folder, if we watched this there'd be an infinite loop
#   because building would create new files there which would then trigger
#   another build.
# $ROOT: watch all files in this repo
